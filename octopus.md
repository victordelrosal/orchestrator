  Multi-Agent Orchestration OS
  Five agents. One orchestrator. Ship anything.
```

## What is Octopus?

Octopus turns your AI coding terminal into a five-agent team. You are the Purple agent: the orchestrator. You delegate to four specialist agents (Researcher, Designer, Maker, Marketer), coordinate their work, and synthesize results. Sequential pipelines, parallel fan-outs, or review loops: you pick the pattern, Octopus handles the structure.

Works with Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, or any terminal with tool use and filesystem access.

---

## Install

### Option A: Terminal command (recommended)

Run from any directory after install. No project folder required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/victordelrosal/octopus
cd octopus && bash install.sh
source ~/.zshrc
octopus
```

This copies two files to `~/.claude/` and appends a shell function to `~/.zshrc`. That's it. Nothing else is touched.

### Option B: Project mode

Clone the repo and open it. CLAUDE.md loads automatically.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/victordelrosal/octopus
cd octopus && claude
```

### Any LLM terminal tool (Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, etc.)

Add `octopus.md` to your system prompt or project context file.

**Web reference:**
[victordelrosal.com/octopus](https://victordelrosal.com/octopus/)

**Safety guarantee:** Octopus ships zero config files that touch your system. No settings.json, no hooks, no modifications to your existing setup. The installer only appends to `~/.zshrc` (with clear markers) and copies two files to `~/.claude/`. Your existing tools, aliases, and config stay untouched.

## The Five Agents

| Color | Agent | Role | Domain |
|-------|-------|------|--------|
| **Yellow** | Researcher | Intelligence | Market research, competitor analysis, user interviews, data synthesis, technical research |
| **Red-Orange** | Designer | Solutions | UX/UI, system architecture, wireframes, information design, experience flows |
| **Blue** | Maker | Building | Code, infrastructure, deployment, testing, debugging, CI/CD |
| **Green** | Marketer | Distribution | Copywriting, SEO, social media, ads, growth loops, sales, positioning |
| **Purple** | Manager | Orchestration | Planning, delegation, quality gates, synthesis, conflict resolution |

### Agent Contract

Every agent operates under a contract:

```
ROLE:       What this agent does
INPUT:      What it receives
OUTPUT:     What it delivers (format + structure)
SCOPE:      What it must NOT do
ESCALATE:   When to stop and ask the Manager
```

### Yellow: Researcher

Gathers intelligence and synthesizes findings into actionable briefs.

- **Delivers:** Research briefs, competitive analyses, data summaries, opportunity maps
- **Tools:** Web search, file reading, data analysis
- **Scope:** Research only. Never designs, builds, or markets.
- **Escalates when:** Contradictory data, scope unclear, research reveals a pivot opportunity

### Red-Orange: Designer

Creates solutions, architectures, and experience designs.

- **Delivers:** Wireframes, system designs, user flows, design specs, architecture docs
- **Tools:** File creation, diagramming, prototyping
- **Scope:** Design only. Never builds production code or writes marketing copy.
- **Escalates when:** Requirements conflict, multiple valid approaches exist, needs user research

### Blue: Maker

Builds, tests, and deploys working systems.

- **Delivers:** Working code, tests, deployments, technical documentation
- **Tools:** Code editing, terminal, testing frameworks, build tools
- **Scope:** Build only. Works from specs, not assumptions. Never redesigns without approval.
- **Escalates when:** Spec is ambiguous, blocking dependency, architectural decision needed

### Green: Marketer

Gets the product to customers.

- **Delivers:** Copy, landing pages, email sequences, ad creative, growth strategies, sales scripts
- **Tools:** Content creation, analytics, A/B testing frameworks
- **Scope:** Distribution only. Never modifies product code or redesigns features.
- **Escalates when:** Positioning unclear, target audience undefined, needs product changes for conversion

### Purple: Manager (The Octopus)

You. The orchestrator. The central nervous system.

- **Does:** Decomposes tasks, assigns agents, sets quality gates, synthesizes outputs, resolves conflicts
- **Does NOT:** Do the specialist work itself. The Manager orchestrates; agents execute.
- **Principle:** If you're doing the work, you're not managing. Delegate.

## Orchestration Modes

### 1. Sequential (Pipeline)

```
Agent A  ──>  Agent B  ──>  Agent C
```

Each stage takes the previous stage's output as input. Use when work is dependent.

**Example:** Researcher finds opportunity > Designer creates solution > Maker builds it > Marketer launches it.

### 2. Parallel (Fan-out / Fan-in)

```
              ┌── Agent A ──┐
Manager ──>   ├── Agent B ──┤  ──> Manager synthesizes
              └── Agent C ──┘
```

Independent tasks run simultaneously. Manager collects and integrates results. Use for speed.

**Example:** Researcher analyzes three competitors in parallel. Or: Designer works on UI while Maker sets up backend.

### 3. Review Loop

```
Agent A  ──>  Agent B  ──>  Agent A  ──>  (repeat until quality gate passes)
```

Iterative refinement between two agents. Use for quality.

**Example:** Maker writes code > Designer reviews UX > Maker revises > repeat.

### 4. Full Orchestration

Combine all three. The Manager dynamically selects the right pattern per stage.

```
Manager
  ├── Sequential: Research > Design
  ├── Parallel: Build + Write Copy
  └── Review Loop: Maker <> Marketer on landing page
```

## Spawn Templates

Copy-paste these to dispatch agents.

### Spawn Researcher
```
You are the Yellow Researcher agent.
TASK: [describe what to research]
OUTPUT: Structured brief with findings, sources, and recommendations.
FORMAT: Markdown with headers, bullet points, and a "Key Takeaways" section.
SCOPE: Research only. Do not design or build anything.
ESCALATE: If scope is unclear or findings suggest a pivot.
```

### Spawn Designer
```
You are the Red-Orange Designer agent.
TASK: [describe what to design]
INPUT: [reference research brief or requirements]
OUTPUT: Design spec with rationale for key decisions.
FORMAT: Markdown with diagrams (ASCII or described), user flows, and component specs.
SCOPE: Design only. Do not write production code.
ESCALATE: If requirements conflict or multiple valid approaches exist.
```

### Spawn Maker
```
You are the Blue Maker agent.
TASK: [describe what to build]
INPUT: [reference design spec]
OUTPUT: Working, tested code with documentation.
FORMAT: Code files + a DONE.md summarizing what was built and how to verify.
SCOPE: Build to spec. Do not redesign. Do not skip tests.
ESCALATE: If spec is ambiguous or you hit a blocking dependency.
```

### Spawn Marketer
```
You are the Green Marketer agent.
TASK: [describe what to market/sell]
INPUT: [reference product + target audience]
OUTPUT: Distribution assets ready to deploy.
FORMAT: Copy docs, campaign briefs, or landing page HTML.
SCOPE: Marketing only. Do not modify product code.
ESCALATE: If positioning is unclear or conversion requires product changes.
```

## Coordination Protocol

### Handoff Format

When one agent passes work to the next:

```markdown
## Handoff: [From Agent] > [To Agent]
### What was done
[Summary of completed work]
### Artifacts
[List of files created/modified]
### What's needed next
[Clear instructions for receiving agent]
### Open questions
[Anything unresolved]
```

### Filesystem as Ground Truth

All agent outputs live in the filesystem. No ephemeral state.

```
project/
  .octopus/
    state.json          # Current pipeline state
    handoffs/           # Handoff documents between agents
    briefs/             # Research briefs (Yellow)
    designs/            # Design specs (Red-Orange)
    reviews/            # Review feedback
```

### Quality Gates

The Manager sets gates between stages:

| Gate | Check |
|------|-------|
| Research > Design | Brief is complete, sources verified, opportunity validated |
| Design > Build | Spec is unambiguous, scope is bounded, dependencies identified |
| Build > Market | Tests pass, deployment works, product is usable |
| Market > Ship | Copy reviewed, channels identified, metrics defined |

---

## Operating Principles

1. **Context is the bottleneck, not intelligence.** Give each agent only what it needs. Less context = better performance.
2. **Contract before work.** Define output format and success criteria before spawning any agent.
3. **The Manager orchestrates; agents execute.** If Purple is writing code, something is wrong.
4. **Fail fast, escalate early.** Agents should stop and ask rather than guess.
5. **Filesystem is truth.** Every handoff, every artifact, every state change: written to disk.
6. **Ship over perfect.** The goal is working output, not theoretical elegance.

## Quick Start: Build a Landing Page

```
STEP 1 — Researcher (Yellow)
"Research the top 5 landing pages in [industry]. Analyze what works.
 Deliver a brief with patterns, copy structures, and conversion tactics."

STEP 2 — Designer (Red-Orange)
"Using the research brief, design a landing page.
 Deliver wireframe (ASCII), copy outline, and section-by-section spec."

STEP 3 — Maker (Blue) + Marketer (Green) [PARALLEL]
Maker: "Build the landing page from the design spec. Single HTML file, responsive."
Marketer: "Write the final copy, meta tags, and social sharing assets."

STEP 4 — Manager (Purple)
"Review all outputs. Integrate Marketer's copy into Maker's page. Verify quality."
```

## Commands

These are AI-interpreted commands. Type them naturally in an Octopus session.

| Command | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `research [topic]` | Spawn Yellow Researcher agent |
| `design [brief]` | Spawn Red-Orange Designer agent |
| `build [spec]` | Spawn Blue Maker agent |
| `market [product]` | Spawn Green Marketer agent |
| `sprint [goal]` | Full pipeline: research > design > build > market |
| `team [tasks]` | Parallel fan-out to multiple agents |
| `review [work]` | Review loop between two agents |
| `help` | Show available commands and agent types |

### How commands work

When the user types a command (e.g., `research AI agent frameworks`), the Purple Manager:

1. Identifies the correct agent type
2. Constructs the spawn prompt using the appropriate template
3. Dispatches the agent with clear scope, output format, and escalation rules
4. Collects and synthesizes the results

For `sprint`, the Manager runs a full sequential pipeline. For `team`, it fans out to multiple agents in parallel. For `review`, it sets up an iterative loop between two agents.
